# Rin Library

This library provides functionality for classes, models, collections, events, and serialization (with schemas) that might not be ground-breaking but are certainly pretty useful.



<br/>

## Installation

You can use npm to install the library, or download the standalone `rin.js` file from the `dist` folder and include it in your index.html file, in the latter case an object named 'Rin' or 'rin' will be available in the global scope.

```sh
npm i @rsthn/rin
```
